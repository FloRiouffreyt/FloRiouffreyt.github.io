## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

A new usage of the fecth() method in JS, for an API, this time.
Very interesting and actually pretty easy when you start to use it more and more.
I learned about the "init" options that can be included in the fetch request, in this example the cache stored the response and would not update when simply refreshing the page or clicking the button. A "no-cache" parameter did the trick.
