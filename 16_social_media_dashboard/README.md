## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I always worked with a single style sheet. Switching theme with the ":root" set on a "light" and a "dark" CSS sheet while importing a "global" stylesheet seems to work fine. Also, big thanks to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) for the inspiration and the local storage trick to allow the users to stay on their prefered theme everytime they open or reload the page. Probably seems obvious to seasoned web devs but it was a very fun challenge, I really enjoyed it!
