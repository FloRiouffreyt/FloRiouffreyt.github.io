## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I already used "fragment" in my ReactJS courses, but I was glad to be able to use it also in vanilla JS. I keep practicing with fetch() and Json handling, very useful. It is still not perfect but building projects helps a lot.
