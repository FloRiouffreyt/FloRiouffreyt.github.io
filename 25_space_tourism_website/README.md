### What I learned

Many many things since I just started using React recently and had zero experience outside of a video formation from UDEMY.
I saw the routing again, managed to make it work.
I learnt more about mobile UI and touch screens, and managed to use the "ontouchstart" and "ontouchend" events to allow my "crew" slider to be used with fingers on mobile, so very happy about this.
I increased my knowledge of React (a bit), understand the hooks a little better now, and will keep working and improving, hopefully!
I also had a little bit of fun with a few discreet animations, just so the pages would be a little more "alive", not too much though.
